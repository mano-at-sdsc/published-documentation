The `file.tsv` table will contain one row for each file in your program.


Field | Field Description | Required? | Field Value Type | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|:-----------:|:-------------:|------------
**id_namespace** | A CFDE-cleared identifier representing the top-level data space containing this file [part 1 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | `id_namespace` is a unique URI prefix pre-registered with CFDE and attached to your program (or a subset of your program) that identifies anything labeled with it as belonging to you. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is built and used.
**local_id** | An identifier representing this file, unique within this id_namespace [part 2 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | The string formed by concatenating the `id_namespace` and `local_id` field values must be unique for each row in this table.  Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.
**project_id_namespace** | The id_namespace of the primary project within which this file was created [part 1 of 2-component composite foreign key] | Required | string | 
**project_local_id** | The local_id of the primary project within which this file was created [part 2 of 2-component composite foreign key] | Required | string | 
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not necessarily retrievable) URI or compact ID permanently attached to this file | Optional | string | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this file) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached, including information enabling resolution to a network location through which the file can be accessed. **Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier: one level of indirection is required in order to protect persistent_id values from changes in network location over time as files are moved around.** Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.

**sha256** | (preferred) SHA-256 checksum for this file [sha256, md5 cannot both be null] | **Either this field OR md5 must be populated** | Value should be HSA-256 hash or nothing; If you have both please use sha256 | You may populate both md5 and sha256 for a given row, but only one is required
**md5** | (allowed) MD5 checksum for this file [sha256, md5 cannot both be null]| **Either this field OR sha256 must be populated** | Value should be MD5 hash or nothing; If you have both, please use sha256. | You may populate both md5 and sha256 for a given row but only one is required
**filename** | A filename with no prepended PATH information. | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | Value type is string | Filenames do not need to be unique. Uniqueness is ensured by the local_id 
**file_format** | An EDAM CV term ID identifying the digital format of this file (e.g. TSV or FASTQ) | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | Value must be a valid EDAM ID | [EDAM format lookup](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/edam/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fedamontology.org%2Fformat_1915&viewMode=All&siblings=false) <br /> Example valid EDAM IDs:<br /> `format:1930`<br /> `format:3712`<br /> `format:2310`

**assay_type** | An OBI CV term ID describing the type of experiment that generated the results summarized by this file | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | Value must be a valid OBI ID | [OBI lookup service](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/OBI?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070)<br /> Example valid OBI IDs: <br />  `OBI:0000366`<br />  `OBI:0001177`<br />  `OBI:0002763`
