The `file.tsv` table will contain one row for each file in your program.


Field | Field Description | Required? | Field Value Type | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|:-----------:|:-------------:|------------
**id_namespace** | A CFDE-cleared identifier representing the top-level data space containing this file [part 1 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | `id_namespace` is a unique URI prefix pre-registered with CFDE and attached to your program (or a subset of your program) that identifies anything labeled with it as belonging to you. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is built and used.
**local_id** | An identifier representing this file, unique within this id_namespace [part 2 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | The string formed by concatenating the `id_namespace` and `local_id` field values must be unique for each row in this table.  Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.
**project_id_namespace** | The id_namespace of the primary project within which this file was created [part 1 of 2-component composite foreign key] | Required | string | This will be the value of `id_namespace` in the row in [project.tsv](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) corresponding to the primary project that generated this file. If your program has not registered multiple CFDE identifier namespaces, this will be exactly the same value for all rows.
**project_local_id** | The local_id of the primary project within which this file was created [part 2 of 2-component composite foreign key] | Required | string | This will be the value of `local_id` in the row in [project.tsv](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) corresponding to the primary project that generated this file.
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not necessarily retrievable) URI or compact ID permanently attached to this file | Optional | string | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this file) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached, including information enabling resolution to a network location through which the file can be accessed. **Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier: one level of indirection is required in order to protect persistent_id values from changes in network location over time as files are moved around.** Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.
**creation_time** | An ISO 8601 -; RFC 3339 (subset)-compliant timestamp documenting this file's creation time | Optional | (string) YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSÂ±NN:NN | Examples: <br/> `2021-01-08T00:00:00-00:00` ("Jan 8, 2021") <br/> `2021-00-00T00:00:00-00:00` ("2021") <br/>  `2021-01-08T00:45:40-04:00` ("Jan 8, 2021, 12:45:40AM, Zulu minus 4") <br/> Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#common-entity-fields) for a complete treatment.
**size_in_bytes** | The size of this file in bytes | Optional | integer | 
**uncompressed_size_in_bytes** | The total decompressed size in bytes of the contents of this file | Optional | integer |
**sha256** | (preferred) SHA-256 checksum for this file | **At least one of `sha256` or `md5` must be populated** | SHA-256 hash string |
**md5** | (deprecated but allowed) MD5 checksum for this file | **At least one of `sha256` or `md5` must be populated** | MD5 hash string |
**filename** | A filename with no prepended PATH information. | Optional | string | `filename` values do not need to be unique: record uniqueness is ensured by `local_id`. 
**file_format** | An EDAM CV term ID identifying the digital format of this file (e.g. TSV or FASTQ) | Optional | A valid EDAM `format:` term | [EDAM `format:` term lookup](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/edam/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fedamontology.org%2Fformat_1915&viewMode=All&siblings=false) <br/> Example: `format:1930`
**data_type** | An EDAM CV term ID identifying the type of information stored in this file (e.g. RNA sequence reads) | Optional | A valid EDAM `data:` term | [EDAM `data:` term lookup](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/edam/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fedamontology.org%2Fdata_0006&viewMode=All&siblings=false) <br/> Example: `data:2044`
**assay_type** | An OBI CV term ID describing the type of experiment that generated the results summarized by this file | Optional | A valid OBI term | [OBI lookup service](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/OBI?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070) <br/> Example: `OBI:0002763`
**mime_type** | A MIME type describing this file | Optional | string | [Common MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types) <br/> --- <br/> [Tutorial for bulk MIME type identification](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/CFDE-Internal-Training/MIME-type/) <br/> --- <br/> Examples: <br/> `image/jpeg` <br/> `text/html` <br/>  `application/octet&#8209;stream`
