The collection_in_collection table will contain one row per nested collection in your organization. 

If you are nesting multiple collections within each other, you should only specify the most proximate relationships. e.g. if you have the collections `Dogs`, `Cats`, `Animals`, `LivingThings` your table should have a for each of: `Cats` in `Animals`, `Dogs` in `Animals`, and `Animals` in `LivingThings`. But you should _not_ additionally specify `Dogs` in `LivingThings`, as that relationship will be derived from the inherent tree-like structure.


Field | Field Description | Required? |  Attributes | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|------------
**superset_collection_id_namespace** | ID of the identifier namespace corresponding to the top-level C2M2 metadataset containing the superset collection  | Required if table is populated | Value type is string | This will be the value of 'id_namespace' in [collection.tsv](./TableInfo:-collection.tsv) for this collection. If your program has not implemented multiple id_namespaces, this will be exactly the same for all rows of this column and the `subset_collection_id_namespace` column 
**superset_collection_local_id** | The ID of the superset collection | Required if table is populated |Value type is string |  This will be a value of 'local_id' in [collection.tsv](./TableInfo:-collection.tsv)
**subset_collection_id_namespace** |ID of the identifier namespace corresponding to the top-level C2M2 metadataset containing the subset collection | Required if table is populated | Value type is string | This will be the value of 'id_namespace' in [collection.tsv](./TableInfo:-collection.tsv) for this collection. If your program has not implemented multiple id_namespaces, this will be exactly the same for all rows of this column and the `superset_collection_id_namespace` column
**subset_collection_local_id** | The ID of the subset collection | Required if table is populated |Value type is string | This will be a value of 'local_id' in [collection.tsv](./TableInfo:-collection.tsv)
