The project table will contain one row per project in your Program

If you have more than one project, you must specify the top level project in the [primary_dcc_contact table](./TableInfo:-primary_dcc_contact.tsv) AND populate the [project_in_project table](./TableInfo:project_in_project) to show the relationships between projects


Field | Field Description | Required? | Field Value Type | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|:-----------:|:-------------:|------------
**id_namespace** | A CFDE-cleared identifier representing the top-level data space containing this project [part 1 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | Value type is string | `id_namespace` is a unique URI prefix pre-registered with CFDE and attached to your program (or a subset of your program) that identifies anything labeled with it as belonging to you. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is built and used.
**local_id** | An identifier representing this project, unique within this id_namespace [part 2 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | The string formed by concatenating the `id_namespace` and `local_id` field values must be unique for each row in this table. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not necessarily retrievable) URI or compact ID permanently attached to this project | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | The value in each row must be different<br /><br />   Value type is string | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this project) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached, including information enabling resolution to a network location from which the file can be downloaded. Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier: one level of indirection is required in order to protect persistent_id values from changes in network location over time as files are moved around.
**creation_time** | An ISO 8601 -; RFC 3339 (subset)-compliant timestamp documenting this file's creation time: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS¬±NN:NN | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | Value must be datetime  | Example valid dates: <br /> `2021-01-08`<br />  `2021-01-08T00:45:40Z`<br />  `2021-01-08T00:45:40+00:00`| 
**abbreviation** | A very short display label for this project | Optional | string | Should not exceed 10 characters; can only contain 0-9, a-z, A-Z and underscore ("`_`")
**name** | A short, human-readable, machine-read-friendly label for this project | Required | string | Must be unique to each project.
**description** | A human-readable description of this project |  Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled  | Value type is string | This is the display description for this project in the portal
