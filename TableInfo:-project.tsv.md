The C2M2 `project` entity is a generic container for groups of files, biosamples and/or subjects that are part of the same research endeavor.

At least one project must be defined for each program. The `project.tsv` table will have one row for each project you define for your program.

Please see the technical documentation for a complete treatment of [how C2M2 projects are used](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#project), paying special attention to both the section on the [project_in_project.tsv](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#association-tables-expressing-containment-relationships) (subproject containment) table and also the section describing the project foreign key requirement for the [primary_dcc_contact.tsv](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#the-primary_dcc_contact-table) table.

Field | Field Description | Required? | Field Value Type | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|:-----------:|:-------------:|------------
**id_namespace** | A CFDE-cleared identifier representing the top-level data space containing this project [part 1 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | `id_namespace` is a unique URI prefix pre-registered with CFDE and attached to your program (or a subset of your program) that identifies anything labeled with it as belonging to you. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is built and used.
**local_id** | An identifier representing this project, unique within this id_namespace [part 2 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | The string formed by concatenating the `id_namespace` and `local_id` field values must be unique for each row in this table. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not necessarily retrievable) URI or compact ID permanently attached to this project | Optional | string | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this project) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.
