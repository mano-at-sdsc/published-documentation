The C2M2 `project` entity is a generic container for groups of files, biosamples and/or subjects that are part of the same research endeavor.

At least one project must be defined as the root (top-level project) for each submitting Common Fund Program, representing the Program itself. The `project.tsv` table will have one row for each project you define. Subprojects can be assigned using the [project_in_project.tsv](./TableInfo:-project_in_project.tsv) table.


Field | Field Description | Required? | Field Value Type | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|:-----------:|:-------------:|------------
**id_namespace** | A CFDE-cleared identifier representing the top-level data space containing this project [part 1 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | `id_namespace` is a unique URI prefix pre-registered with CFDE and attached to your program (or a subset of your program) that identifies anything labeled with it as belonging to you. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is built and used.
**local_id** | An identifier representing this project, unique within this id_namespace [part 2 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | The string formed by concatenating the `id_namespace` and `local_id` field values must be unique for each row in this table. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not necessarily retrievable) URI or compact ID permanently attached to this project | Optional | string | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this project) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.
**creation_time** | An ISO 8601 -; RFC 3339 (subset)-compliant timestamp documenting this project's creation time | Optional | (string) YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSÂ±NN:NN | Examples: <br/> `2021-01-08T00:00:00-00:00` ("Jan 8, 2021") <br/> `2021-00-00T00:00:00-00:00` ("2021") <br/>  `2021-01-08T00:45:40-04:00` ("Jan 8, 2021, 12:45:40AM, Zulu minus 4") <br/> Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#common-entity-fields) for a complete treatment.
**abbreviation** | A very short display label for this project | Optional | string | Should not exceed 10 characters; can only contain 0-9, a-z, A-Z and underscore ("`_`")
**name** | A short, human-readable, machine-read-friendly label for this project | Required | string | Must be unique to each project.
**description** | A human-readable description of this project | Optional | string |
