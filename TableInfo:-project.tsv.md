The project table will contain one row per project in your Program

If you have more than one project, you must specify the top level project in the [primary_dcc_contact table](./TableInfo:-primary_dcc_contact.tsv) AND populate the [project_in_project table](./TableInfo:project_in_project) to show the relationships between projects


Field | Field Description | Required? |  Attributes | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|------------
**id_namespace** | A CFDE-cleared identifier representing the top-level data space containing this project [part 1 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | Value type is string | id_namespace is the unique identifier for your program, or some subset of your program, that identifies it as your data. In the simplest case, your program would use the exact same value for the id_namespace column in every row for every table. More complex Programs may choose to use multiple namespaces. id_namespaces should all be listed in the [id_namespace.tsv](./TableInfo:-id_namespace.tsv)
**local_id** | An identifier representing this project, unique within this id_namespace [part 2 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required| The value in each row must be different for a given namespace <br /><br />   Value type is string | Each individual project needs a unique local_id value (every row should be different). The local_id column appears in many tables but values should not be repeated across tables. e.g. 'file' local_id is a separate concept from 'biosample' local_id. If your program is using a single id_namespace, then every value for local_id across all tables should be unique. If you have more than one project, you must specify the top level project in the [primary_dcc_contact table](./TableInfo:-primary_dcc_contact.tsv) AND populate the [project_in_project table](./TableInfo:project_in_project) to show the relationships between projects
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not necessarily retrievable) URI or compact ID permanently attached to this project | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | The value in each row must be different<br /><br />   Value type is string | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this project) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached, including information enabling resolution to a network location from which the file can be downloaded. Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier: one level of indirection is required in order to protect persistent_id values from changes in network location over time as files are moved around.
**creation_time** | An ISO 8601 -; RFC 3339 (subset)-compliant timestamp documenting this file's creation time: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS¬±NN:NN | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | Value must be datetime  | Example valid dates: <br /> `2021-01-08`<br />  `2021-01-08T00:45:40Z`<br />  `2021-01-08T00:45:40+00:00`| 
**abbreviation** | A very short display label for this project |Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled  | Value can be any string that is not already in use at the CFDE <br /><br />  Value should be 10 characters or fewer | This is the display abbreviation for this project in the portal
**name** | A short, human-readable, machine-read-friendly label for this project | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled  | Value type is string | This is the display name for this project in the portal
**description** | A human-readable description of this project |  Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled  | Value type is string | This is the display description for this project in the portal
