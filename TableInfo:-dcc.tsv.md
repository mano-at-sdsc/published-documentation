The `dcc.tsv` (formerly `primary_dcc_contact.tsv`) table must contain **exactly one row** describing a technical contact for this C2M2 datapackage. This table's `project` foreign key (the last two fields) should refer to the artificial top-level entry in the `project` table that represents the DCC's total C2M2 submission (see [`project.tsv`](./TableInfo:-project.tsv)).

Field | Field Description | Required? | Field&nbsp;Value&nbsp;Type | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|:-----------:|:-------------:|------------
**id** | The identifier for this DCC, issued by the CFDE-CC. | Required | Example: `cfde_registry_dcc:hmp`
**dcc_name** | A short, human-readable, machine-read-friendly label for this contact's program or DCC | Required | string | This is the display name for your program in the CFDE portal.
**dcc_abbreviation** | A very short display label for this contact's program or DCC | Required | string | Should not exceed 10 characters; can only contain 0-9, a-z, A-Z and underscore ("`_`"). This is the display abbreviation for your program in the CFDE portal.
**dcc_description** | A human-readable description of this contact's program or DCC | Required | string | This is the display description for your program in the CFDE portal.
**contact_email** | Email address of this contact | Required | A valid email address | 
**contact_name** | Name of this contact | Required | string | The name of a person who can answer any questions CFDE staff have during submission processing
**dcc_url** | URL of the front page of the website for this contact's program or DCC | Required | A valid URL | Example: `https://www.hmpdacc.org/`
**project_id_namespace** | The id_namespace of the project record representing the top-level C2M2 metadataset produced by this contact's program or DCC [part 1 of 2-component composite foreign key] | Required | string | This will be the value of 'id_namespace' in the [project.tsv](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) table for the overarching project record representing your entire program.
**project_local_id** | The local_id of the project record representing the top-level C2M2 metadataset produced by this contact's program or DCC [part 2 of 2-component composite foreign key] | Required | string | This will be the value of `local_id` in the [project.tsv](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) table for the overarching project record representing your entire program. If you have only a single project, this is that project. If you have more than one project, create a 'dummy project' to represent your entire program and contain all other projects (as subprojects: see the [project_in_project.tsv](./TableInfo:-project_in_project.tsv) table for how to express these relationships).
