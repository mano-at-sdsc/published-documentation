Each DCC can only have one approved datapackage in each data release. If you approve multiple packages between data releases, only the most recently submitted and approved package will be used.

1. Go to https://app.nih-cfde.org/ and click "Log In" (top right corner).
2. Click your name and "My Profile" (top right corner). 
   - Check that under "Groups" it says you're an Approver for your DCC.
3. Click on “List all submissions” under the "For submitters" tab at top of page. 
4. You should see a table with 3 columns: Actions, Submission, and Status Summary. 
   - The status of your data package is in the "Status Summary" column by "Ingest Status".
5. To view a table with the number of items submitted during data ingestion (number of files, biosamples, subjects, etc.), click on the document icon in the "Actions" column to "View Details". 
6. To view how users will see your metadata in the portal, in the "Status Summary" column, click "Browse Data".
