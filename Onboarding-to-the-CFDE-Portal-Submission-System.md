As a Common Fund Data Coordinating Center (DCC) you have 3 role options for your users of the submission system:
- **Reviewer**: This is a read only account. Users can see submitted packages, but can’t do anything with them. You can have as many users in this role as you want.
- **Submitter**: Can submit data packages, but can’t approve a package for inclusion in the public portal. You can have as many users in this role as you want.
- **Approver**: Can approve a submitted package to be published to the CFDE portal, but can’t submit new packages. Each DCC has one person who is the final approver.

Any given person in your organization can have 0-3 roles. If they have 0, then they can only see the published data, so they will have exactly the same privileges as any regular user of the portal. 

If a user has one or more of the other roles, they get those privileges. Privileges stack. So if one person needs to submit packages and is the final approver, then they need to have both roles.  

We’re still working out how we will administer roles long term in practice. For the moment, @ACharbonneau is acting as admin on all of them until we’re sure the system is working.

To do the onboarding, for each person in your org who needs a role you will need to tell us:
- [their Globus display name](https://github.com/nih-cfde/security/blob/master/epic-1-groups/dcc-instructions.md)
- what role(s) you want them to have
