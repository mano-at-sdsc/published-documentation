The `subject.tsv` table will contain one row per subject in your program.

Field | Field Description | Required? | Field Value Type | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|:-----------:|:-------------:|------------
**id_namespace** | A CFDE-cleared identifier representing the top-level data space containing this subject [part 1 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | `id_namespace` is a unique URI prefix pre-registered with CFDE and attached to your program (or a subset of your program) that identifies anything labeled with it as belonging to you. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is built and used.
**local_id** | An identifier representing this subject, unique within this id_namespace [part 2 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | The string formed by concatenating the `id_namespace` and `local_id` field values must be unique for each row in this table. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.
**project_id_namespace** | The id_namespace of the primary project within which this subject was observed [part 1 of 2-component composite foreign key] | Required | string | This will be the value of `id_namespace` in the row in [project.tsv](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) corresponding to the primary project that observed this subject. If your program has not registered multiple CFDE identifier namespaces, this will be exactly the same value for all rows.
**project_local_id** | The local_id of the primary project within which this subject was observed [part 2 of 2-component composite foreign key] | Required | string | This will be the value of `local_id` in the row in [project.tsv](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) corresponding to the primary project that observed this subject.
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not necessarily retrievable) URI or compact ID permanently attached to this subject | Optional | string | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this subject) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is to be used.
**creation_time** | An ISO 8601 -; RFC 3339 (subset)-compliant timestamp documenting this biosample's creation time | Optional | (string) YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSÂ±NN:NN | Examples: <br/> `2021-01-08T00:00:00-00:00` ("Jan 8, 2021") <br/> `2021-00-00T00:00:00-00:00` ("2021") <br/>  `2021-01-08T00:45:40-04:00` ("Jan 8, 2021, 12:45:40AM, Zulu minus 4") <br/> Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#common-entity-fields) for a complete treatment.
**granularity** | A CFDE CV term categorizing this subject by multiplicity | Required | enum of strings | [Table of allowed values](https://osf.io/gpf3d/)
**sex** | The sex of this subject | optional | string enum of strings | [Table of allowed values](https://osf.io/wepsz/)
**ethnicity** | The ethnicity of this subject | optional | string enum of strings | [Table of allowed values](https://osf.io/5gy7r/)
