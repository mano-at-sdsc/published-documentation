The subject table will contain one row per subject in your Program			

Field | Field Description | Required? |  Attributes | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|------------
**id_namespace** | ID of the identifier namespace corresponding to the top-level C2M2 metadataset containing this file	| Required | Every row must have a value; Value type is string | id_namespace is the unique identifier for your program, or some subset of your program, that identifies it as your data. In the simplest case, your program would use the exact same value for the id_namespace column in every row for every table. More complex Programs may choose to use multiple namespaces. id_namespaces should all be listed in the [primary_dcc_contact table](./TableInfo:-primary_dcc_contact.tsv)
**local_id** | An ID representing this subject, unique within this id_namespace | Required|  Every row must have a value; The value in each row must be different for a given namespace; Value type is string | Each individual subject needs a unique local_id value (every row should be different). The local_id column appears in many tables but values should not be repeated across tables. e.g. 'file' local_id is a separate concept from 'biosample' local_id. If your program is using a single id_namespace, then every value for every local_id across all tables should be unique.
**project_id_namespace** | ID of the identifier namespace for the primary project that this subject belongs to | Required | Column header must be used, Every row must have a value, Value type is string | If you have not implemented multiple namespaces, this will be the same as id_namespace. 
**project_local_id** | Foreign key identifying the primary project this subject belongs to | Required | Every row must have a value; Value can be any string | For each row (each subject), this will be the value of 'local_id' in the [project table](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) for the project this subject belongs to
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not nec. retrievable) URI generated by a DCC (using, e.g. our minid server) and attached to this subject | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | The value in each row must be different; Value type is string  | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this subject) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached, including information enabling resolution to a network location from which the file can be downloaded. **Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier: one level of indirection is required in order to protect persistent_id values from changes in network location over time as files are moved around.**
**creation_time** | An ISO 8601 -; RFC 3339 (subset)-compliant timestamp documenting this file's creation time: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS¬±NN:NN | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | Value must be datetime  | Example valid dates: `2021-01-08`, `2021-01-08T00:45:40Z`, `2021-01-08T00:45:40+00:00`
**granularity** | A CFDE CV term categorizing this subject by multiplicity | Required | Every row must have a value; Value must be a valid cfde_subject_granularity, in the form: `cfde_subject_granularity:X e.g. cfde_subject_granularity:0` | [Table of allowed values](https://osf.io/gpf3d/)
