If you have populated [collection.tsv](./TableInfo:-collection.tsv) you must assign those collections to projects

collection_defined_by_project table will contain one row per collection in [collection.tsv](./TableInfo:-collection.tsv) 			

Field | Field Description | Required? |  Attributes | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|------------
**collection_id_namespace** | ID of the identifier namespace corresponding to the top-level C2M2 metadataset containing this collection | Required if table is populated | Value type is string | For each row (each collection), this will be the value of 'id_namespace' in [collection.tsv](./TableInfo:-collection.tsv) for this collection. If your program has not implemented multiple id_namespaces, this will be exactly the same for all rows of this column and the the `project_id_namespace` column
**collection_local_id** | The ID of this collection | Required if table is populated | Value type is string | For each row (each collection), this will be the value of 'local_id' in [collection.tsv](./TableInfo:-collection.tsv) for this biosample
**project_id_namespace** | ID of the identifier namespace corresponding to the top-level C2M2 metadataset containing this project| Required if table is populated | Value type is string |For each row (each collection), this will be the value of 'id_namespace' in the project table for the project this collection belongs to. If your program has not implemented multiple id_namespaces, this will be exactly the same for all rows in this column and the `collection_id_namespace` column
**project_local_id** | The ID of this project | Required if table is populated | Value type is string | For each row (each collection), this will be the value of 'local_id' in the project table for the project this collection belongs to. If a biosample should be part of multiple collections, it should have multiple *rows*. **Concatenating values in this column will invalidate your submission**
