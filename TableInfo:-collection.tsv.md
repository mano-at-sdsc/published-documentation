The collection table will have as many rows as you have Collections in your Program. 

This is where all of your Collections are created

Collections are groupings of files, biosamples and/or subjects	

Field | Field Description | Required? |  Attributes | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|------------
**id_namespace** | A CFDE-cleared identifier representing the top-level data space containing this collection [part 1 of 2-component composite primary key] | If a row has this value, local_id must also have a value | Value type is string | If your program has not implemented multiple id_namespaces, this will be exactly the same for all rows <br /><br /> This will be the value of `id_namespace` in [project.tsv](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) for the overarching project in your program and/or the value of project_id_namespace in [primary_dcc_contact](./TableInfo:-primary_dcc_contact.tsv)
**local_id** | If a row has this value, id_namespace must also have a value | An identifier representing this collection, unique within this id_namespace [part 2 of 2-component composite primary key] | The value in each row must be different<br /><br /> Value type is string| Each individual collection needs a unique local_id value (every row should be different). <br /><br />The local_id column appears in many tables but values should not be repeated across tables. e.g. 'file' local_id is a separate concept from 'biosample' local_id. 
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not necessarily retrievable) URI or compact ID permanently attached to this collection | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | The value in each row must be different <br /><br />Value type is string | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this collection) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached, including information enabling resolution to a network location from which the file can be downloaded. **Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier: one level of indirection is required in order to protect persistent_id values from changes in network location over time as files are moved around.**
**creation_time** | An ISO 8601 -; RFC 3339 (subset)-compliant timestamp documenting this Collections creation time: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS¬±NN:NN | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | Value must be datetime  | Example valid dates: <br />`2021-01-08`<br />`2021-01-08T00:45:40Z`><br /> `2021-01-08T00:45:40+00:00`
**abbreviation** | A very short display label for this collection |Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled  | Value can be any string that is not already in use at the CFDE; Value should be 10 characters or fewer | This is the display abbreviation for this collection in the portal
**name** | A short, human-readable, machine-read-friendly label for this collection | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled  | Value type is string | This is the display name for this collection in the portal
**description** | A human-readable description of this collection |  Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled  | Value type is string | This is the display description for this collection in the portal
