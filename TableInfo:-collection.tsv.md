The C2M2 `collection` entity is a generalization of "dataset" -- a named grouping of files, biosamples and/or subjects.

Defining collections is optional. The `collection.tsv table will have one row for each collection you define for your program.

Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#collection) for a complete treatment of how C2M2 collections are used.

Field | Field Description | Required? |  Attributes | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|------------
**id_namespace** | A CFDE-cleared identifier representing the top-level data space containing this collection [part 1 of 2-component composite primary key] | If a row has this value, local_id must also have a value | Value type is string | If your program has not implemented multiple id_namespaces, this will be exactly the same for all rows <br /><br /> This will be the value of `id_namespace` in [project.tsv](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) for the overarching project in your program and/or the value of project_id_namespace in [primary_dcc_contact](./TableInfo:-primary_dcc_contact.tsv)
**local_id** | An identifier representing this collection, unique within this id_namespace [part 2 of 2-component composite primary key] | If a row has this value, id_namespace must also have a value | The value in each row must be different<br /><br /> Value type is string| Each individual collection needs a unique local_id value (every row should be different). <br /><br />The local_id column appears in many tables but values should not be repeated across tables. e.g. 'file' local_id is a separate concept from 'biosample' local_id. 
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not necessarily retrievable) URI or compact ID permanently attached to this collection | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | The value in each row must be different <br /><br />Value type is string | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this collection) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached, including information enabling resolution to a network location from which the file can be downloaded. **Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier: one level of indirection is required in order to protect persistent_id values from changes in network location over time as files are moved around.**
**creation_time** | An ISO 8601 -; RFC 3339 (subset)-compliant timestamp documenting this Collections creation time: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSÂ±NN:NN  | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | Value must be datetime  | Example valid dates: <br />`2021-01-08`<br />`2021-01-08T00:45:40Z`><br /> `2021-01-08T00:45:40+00:00`
**abbreviation** | A very short display label for this collection |Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled  | Value can be any string that is not already in use at the CFDE; Value should be 10 characters or fewer <br /><br /> Cannot contain special unix characters| This is the display abbreviation for this collection in the portal
**name** | A short, human-readable, machine-read-friendly label for this collection | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled  | Value type is string | This is the display name for this collection in the portal
**description** | A human-readable description of this collection |  Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled  | Value type is string | This is the display description for this collection in the portal
