The biosample_in_collection table will contain one row per biosample-collection pair in your Program
Some examples:   
- If you have exactly one collection, and want all your biosamples in that collection, this table will have the same number of rows as your biosample table, and the value for columns 3 and 4 are the same for this entire table
- If you have exactly one collection, and only want *some* of your biosamples in that collection, you will have you will have an equal number of rows and biosamples, where the value for columns 3 and 4 are the same for the entire table
- If each biosample is associated with exactly one collection, you will have an equal number of rows and biosamples.
- If a biosample should appear in two unrelated collections, it will need two rows, where the first two columns are duplicated, and the last two columns specify the two collections
- if a biosample should appear in two or more collections that are defined as being nested in the [collection_in_collection](./TableInfo:-collection_in_collection.tsv) table, it should only appear in one row, with the collection_id_namespace and collection_local_id for the most specific collection. It will inherit the parent collections.

Field | Field Description | Required? |  Attributes | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|------------
biosample_id_namespace | Identifier namespace for this biosample string | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | If a row has this value, it must have a value for every column, Value type is string | For each row (each biosample), this will be the value of 'id_namespace' in the biosample table for this biosample. If your program has not implemented multiple id_namespaces, this will be exactly the same for all rows and for the subject_id_namespace column
biosample_local_id | The ID of this biosample string |  Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | If a row has this value, it must have a value for every column, Value type is string | For each row (each biosample), this will be the value of 'local_id' in the biosample table for this biosample
collection_id_namespace | Identifier namespace for this collection string | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | If a row has this value, it must have a value for every column, Value type is string | For each row (each biosample), this will be the value of 'id_namespace' in the subject table for the subject this biosample was taken from. If your program has not implemented multiple id_namespaces, this will be exactly the same for all rows and for the biosample_id_namespace column
collection_local_id | The ID of this collection string |  Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | If a row has this value, it must have a value for every column, Value type is string | For each row (each biosample), this will be the value of 'local_id' in the subject table for the subject this biosample was taken from. If a biosample should be part of multiple collections, it should have multiple *rows*. Concatenating values in this column will invalidate your submission
