# QuickStart: Building a C2M2 datapackage

The Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2), a flexible metadata standard for describing experimental resources in biomedicine and related fields. The C2M2 is a package of 22 tsv files (6 that must be populated, 11 that can be left empty, and 5 auto-generated on submission) that populate a rich relational database. Assuming you fill all the optional tables, this will make your data searchable by concepts like 'anatomy', 'biosample', 'species', and other similar terms that are useful to researchers. This level can be created at several arbitrary levels of complexity, as several tables can be left empty.
