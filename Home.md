# What is the C2M2?

The Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2), a flexible metadata standard for describing experimental resources in biomedicine and related fields. At the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) we use the C2M2 as our centralized model of participating datasets in a rich relational database hosted at [https://app.nih-cfde.org/](https://app.nih-cfde.org/). This portal supports faceted search of metadata concepts such as anatomical location, species, and assay type, across a wide variety of datasets using a controlled vocabulary. This allows researchers to find a wide variety of data that would otherwise need to be searched individually, using varying nomenclatures. Currently, the portal only accepts C2M2 datapackages from Common Fund Programs. If you represent the Data Coordination Center from a Common Fund Program, and would like to know more about joining the Common Fund Data Ecosystem please contact us by emailing coordination@CFDE.groups.io

# QuickStart: Participating in the CFDE C2M2 datapackage

The Data Coordination Center for each participating Common Fund Program 



Assuming you fill all the optional tables, this will make your data searchable by concepts like 'anatomy', 'biosample', 'species', and other similar terms that are useful to researchers. This level can be created at several arbitrary levels of complexity, as several tables can be left empty.
