The `biosample.tsv` table will contain one row per biosample in your program.

Field | Field Description | Required? | Field Value Type | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|:-----------:|:-------------:|------------
**id_namespace** | A CFDE-cleared identifier representing the top-level data space containing this biosample [part 1 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required | string | `id_namespace` is a unique URI prefix pre-registered with CFDE and attached to your program (or a subset of your program) that identifies anything labeled with it as belonging to you. Please see the [technical documentation](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/#c2m2-identifiers) for a full discussion of how this information is built and used.
**local_id** | An identifier representing this biosample, unique within this id_namespace [part 2 of 2-component composite primary key] | Required |  The value in each row must be different for a given namespace <br /> <br /> Value type is string
**project_id_namespace** | The id_namespace of the primary project within which this biosample was created [part 1 of 2-component composite foreign key] | Required| Value type is string | If you have not implemented multiple namespaces, this will be the same as id_namespace. 
**project_local_id** | The local_id of the primary project within which this biosample was created [part 2 of 2-component composite foreign key] | Required | Value type is string | For each row (each biosample), this will be the value of 'local_id' in the [project table](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) for the project this biosample came from
**persistent_id** | A persistent, resolvable (not necessarily retrievable) URI or compact ID permanently attached to this biosample | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled | The value in each row must be different<br /> <br /> Value type is string | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this file) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached, including information enabling resolution to a network location from which the file can be downloaded. <br /><br />**Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier: one level of indirection is required in order to protect persistent_id values from changes in network location over time as files are moved around.**
**creation_time** | An ISO 8601 -- RFC 3339 (subset)-compliant timestamp documenting this biosample's creation time: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSÂ±NN:NN | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled |  Value must be datetime | Example valid dates: <br />`2021-01-08`<br /> `2021-01-08T00:45:40Z`<br /> `2021-01-08T00:45:40+00:00`
**anatomy** | An UBERON CV term ID used to locate the origin of this biosample within the physiology of its source or host organism | Non-required: Any number of rows after the header can be filled |  Value must be a valid UBERON ID  | [UBERON lookup service](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon) <br /> Example valid UBERON IDs: <br />`UBERON:0001988`<br /> `UBERON:0001052`<br /> `UBERON:0006956`
