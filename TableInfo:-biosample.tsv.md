The biosample table will contain one row per biosample in your Program

Field | Field Description | Required? |  Attributes | Extra Info 
------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|------------
project_id_namespace | ID of the identifier namespace for the primary project within which this biosample was created | Required| Every row must have a value; Value type is string |If you have not implemented multiple namespaces, this will be the same as id_namespace. 
project_local_id | Foreign key identifying the primary project within which this biosample was created | Required | Every row must have a value; Value type is string | For each row (each biosample), this will be the value of 'local_id' in the [project table](./TableInfo:-project.tsv) for the project this biosample came from
persistent_id | A persistent, resolvable (not nec. retrievable) URI generated by a DCC and attached to this biosample | Non-required | The value in each row must be different; Value type is string; Any number of rows can be filled  | Meant to serve as a permanent address to which landing pages (which summarize metadata associated with this file) and other relevant annotations and functions can optionally be attached, including information enabling resolution to a network location from which the file can be downloaded. Actual network locations must not be embedded directly within this identifier: one level of indirection is required in order to protect persistent_id values from changes in network location over time as files are moved around.
creation_time | An ISO 8601 -- RFC 3339 (subset)-compliant timestamp documenting this file's creation time: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSÂ±NN:NN | | Non-required | Any number of rows can be filled; Value must be datetime | Example valid dates: `2021-01-08`, `2021-01-08T00:45:40Z`, `2021-01-08T00:45:40+00:00`
anatomy | An UBERON CV term ID used to locate the origin of this biosample within the physiology of its source or host organism | Non-required |  Value must be a valid UBERON ID; Any number of rows can be filled | [UBERON lookup service](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon) Example valid UBERON IDs: `UBERON:0001988`, `UBERON:0001052`, `UBERON:0006956`
