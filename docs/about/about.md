The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) is developing an online portal that allows researchers to access and work across multiple Common Fund (CF) program datasets within a digital cloud environment. CF programs generate a wide range of diverse and valuable datasets designed to be used by the research community to accelerate discovery. However, these datasets reside in different locations and it is challenging or even impossible to work with multiple datasets in an accessible and user-friendly way. The CFDE portal helps to remedy this problem by creating a shared resource that makes CF datasets FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and enables researchers to ask scientific and clinical questions from a single access point.

The CFDE Coordinating Center oversees CFDE activities and works closely with participating CF data coordinating centers (DCCs) to include an initial set of CF datasets, with plans to expand to additional datasets in the future. The CFDE portal will also develop and deploy a number of resources and tools, including training materials that will be created to empower the research community to use CF datasets for novel scientific research that was not possible before. This may include hypothesis generation, discovery, or validation that leads to new insights in health and disease.
