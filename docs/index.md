# Welcome to the CFDE Documentation

The goal of the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) is to federate data from Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) to improve access to data derived from hundreds of studies and samples collected from thousands of human subjects. This project involves diverse datatypes that have been generated at the genomic, expression, proteomic, metagenomic, and imaging levels, and the contributing DCCs support a tremendous range of scientific discovery efforts.
To facilitate the task of federating the DCCs' data, the CFDE has developed and refined software tools. To view documentation for these tools, please select from the following:

- The [Crosscut Metadata Model](./c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/README.md) (C2M2) provides a flexible standard for describing biomedical experimental data.
- The [Datapackage Submission System](./cfde-submit/docs/index.md) documentation describes how Common Fund metadata is submitted to the [CFDE Search Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/). For help with submissions, you can also check the [wiki](https://github.com/nih-cfde/published-documentation/wiki), search common errors in the [discussion board](https://github.com/nih-cfde/published-documentation/discussions), or read the [CFDE Portal User Guide](./about/portalguide/). 
- The [FAIR cookbook](./the-fair-cookbook/intro.md) provides introductory materials about various aspects of FAIRness, including practical guides that show how to enhance digital objects by adhering to community accepted standards.
